## PHP Login System
This repository contains a fully functional login system developed using PHP. The system enables users to register securely and log in with their credentials. Upon successful registration, users are prompted to log in, where authentication mechanisms ensure only valid users gain access.

Just like any robust authentication system, this login system is built with essential security measures, including input validation, error handling, and session management to enhance usability and data protection. It also integrates a back-end database to store user credentials securely, following best practices in database design and user authentication.

Currently, a home page is under development to provide a user-friendly interface and additional functionalities beyond authentication. Future enhancements may include password recovery, role-based access control, and improved UI/UX design to optimize user experience
